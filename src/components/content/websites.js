      <h1>
        Front-end JavaScript developer from Bristol, specializing in React JS.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've been designing and building websites professionally for over 12
        years. Starting out creating bespoke WordPress sites for small local
        businesses, I then went on to run my own premium theme store. In recent
        years I have fully embraced front-end JavaScript libraries and
        frameworks, and now consider myself a React specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the pleasure of working as a contract front-end developer with
        numerous agencies and companies. As a contractor, I can't publicly
        disclose much of my best work, but if you'd like some examples I can
        point you in the right direction.
      </p>

      <div className={style.contactSection}>
        <p>
          If you are interested in hiring me for a project, either as a
          front-end contract developer or on a freelance basis, please get in
          touch:

      <h2 className={style.skillsTitle}>My key skills &amp; interests</h2>
      <p>
        I love learning and am fasinated by how quickly the JavaScript ecosystem
        is developing. Below are some of the technologies I have been using
        recently.
      </p>

      <div className={style.skillsItem}>
        <img src={reactIcon} />
        <h3>React JS</h3>
        <p>
          React is an open-source javascript library for developing front-end
          user interfaces. It's become immensely popular, and powers some of the
          biggest modern web applications such as Facebook, Instagram and
          Airbnb. It's had a huge impact on how I go about building websites,
          and certainly improved my JavaScript skills no end. I've used React in
          several large-scale projects, and a few smaller side projects. I keep
          a close eye on the latest React library additions such as Context,
          Hooks and Suspense, as well as popular tools like the Next JS
          framework, and Gatsby static-site generator.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={style.skillsItem}>
        <img src={reduxIcon} />
        <h3>Redux</h3>
        <p>
          Redux is a state-management tool for JavaScript applications, and is
          very commonly used alongside React. I used Redux extensively whilst
          developing a complex signup process for an energy management company.
          It is particularly useful for managing data from multiple sources, and
          also in apps that handle a lot of user interaction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={style.skillsItem}>
        <img src={graphqlIcon} />
        <h3>GraphQL</h3>
        <p>
          GraphQL is a language for querying an API. It gives a lot more
          flexibility and efficiency in querying data from a database. I've used
          it on a couple of side projects with React and either Apollo Client or
          Gatsby on the frontend. I'm particularly excited about the future of
          GraphQL and hope to be using it in some larger projects very soon.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={style.skillsItem}>
        <img src={nodeIcon} />
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>
          Node.js allows JavaScript to be run server-side. Express is a commonly
          used framework for Node.js and I've used it to build both RESTful and
          GraphQL APIs. I've been working hard recently on this side of my
          skillset, which would take me into full-stack developer territory.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={style.skillsItem}>
        <img src={uxuiIcon} />
        <h3>UX / UI design</h3>
        <p>
          Coming from a family of architects, well-considered user experience
          and design has always been an interest of mine. I'm equally happy
          crafting user interfaces from scratch or working with designers. I
          strongly believe that the best results come from a close collaboration
          between design and development.
