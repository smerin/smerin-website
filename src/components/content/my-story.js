        <h2>My story so far...</h2>
        <p>
          I've wanted to be a musician since I first picked up the guitar. The
          realities of that dream have taken me on a long journey of learning
          new skills - design and marketing, website development, event
          production, audio engineering, photography, videography and more. On
          top of that, I've never settled on a favourite type of music, and am
          always learning about different music and traditions from all around
          the world, new styles of guitar playing and new instruments such as
          the Kora, a type of harp from West Africa.
        </p>

          Recently I have developed a burning desire to share some of the things
          I've learnt with the wider world. In particular, I want to help
          musicians learn the skills and techniques for self-promotion (such as
          building a website, using graphic design tools, and audio / video
          production). I'd also like to inspire some guitarists to learn some
          different styles of playing from around the world, and also share some
          of the music and songs I've learnt on my travels in Senegal and the
          Gambia.

          So please have a look around and get in touch if you have any ideas or
          feedback. If you'd like some more regular updates I have a mailing
          list, or you can connect on various social networks.

          Enjoy!
